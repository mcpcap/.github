# Welcome to mcpcap

**Bridging Network Analysis and Artificial Intelligence**

## Our Mission

We're building tools that make network traffic analysis accessible to AI systems, enabling natural language interaction with complex network data.

## What We Do

mcpcap transforms traditional network analysis by creating MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that allow AI assistants like Claude to understand and analyze network packet captures through natural conversation.

## Our Vision

Imagine asking an AI: *"What suspicious DNS activity do you see in this capture?"* or *"Help me troubleshoot this DHCP issue"* - and getting expert-level analysis instantly. That's what we're building.

## The Team

mcpcap is developed by network security professionals and AI enthusiasts who believe that the future of network analysis lies in human-AI collaboration.

## Community

- **Contributors Welcome**: From network engineers to AI researchers
- **Open Source**: MIT licensed and community-driven
- **Growing Ecosystem**: New protocol modules and analysis capabilities regularly added

## Featured Projects
